## Acknowledgment

Inspired by [tnote](https://github.com/tasdikrahman/tnote) created by tasdikrahman.
Original repo has some bugs, which have been solved in pull requests.
However, the author is not responding, so I created my own version of the repo with changes I thought was required.

This notes module supports multi-line support for Content field.

## Features
[:arrow_up: Back to top](#index)

- **Dead simple to use**: Even your granny would be able to use it. No seriously!
- **Feature rich** Add your precious note with it's _title_ , _content_ , _tags_
- **Secure**: Encrypts your database using standard **AES-256 in CBC mode**. So even if anybody gets hand of your database file. He cannot make any sense of it. [A little demo of what I am doing using it](https://github.com/tasdikrahman/notes/wiki/So-you-say-it-is-encrypted-eh%3F)

**NOTE**
  _This feature is available/tested only on linux based systems. Support for other OS's coming soon!_

- **Text Highlighting is cross platform** - Supports Linux, Windows, MAC for the terminal based highlighting.
- **Searching for notes is hassle free** in `notes`: It supports full text search for notes based on _content_, _tags_
    - The search query if found in the database will be highlighted if found. Looks pleasing to the eyes
- Ability to add and remove tags for each note.
- Adds timestamp for each note which has been added.
- Written in uncomplicated python.

Need I say more?
